Unsupervised Candidate Answer Extraction through Differentiable Masker-Reconstructor Model

The cleaning/commenting of code and data files for public release is still on my TODO list with a target completion date of 03/15/2024.  
Please email wang@tamu.edu if you have an urgent need of our code and data, and we can share the uncleaned/uncommented version upon receiving your email.

    abstract = "Question generation is a widely used data augmentation approach with extensive applications, and extracting qualified candidate answers from context passages is a critical step for most question generation systems. However, existing methods for candidate answer extraction are reliant on linguistic rules or annotated data that face the partial annotation issue and challenges in generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel unsupervised candidate answer extraction approach that leverages the inherent structure of context passages through a Differentiable Masker-Reconstructor (DMR) Model with the enforcement of self-consistency for picking up salient information tokens. We curated two datasets with exhaustively-annotated answers and benchmark a comprehensive set of supervised and unsupervised candidate answer extraction methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the DMR model by showing its performance is superior among unsupervised methods and comparable to supervised methods.",
